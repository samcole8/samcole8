## Hi, I'm Sam.

Right now, I'm working on:

***tellmewhen*** | Alert scheduling server/container that supports email, SMS and Telegram bots  
***smallwall*** | Small-scale transparent firewall builder  
***ysmr*** | Modular SSH notifications integrated with Logstash *(taking a back seat for the moment)*

Check out my [personal blog](http://samcole.me) for more!
